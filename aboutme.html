         <h4>"To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee</h4>
         <p>I absolutely love "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee. It is a classic novel that explores the complexities of racial inequality and injustice through the eyes of a young girl named Scout Finch. 
            The book is set in the 1930s in the American South and it covers themes of prejudice, integrity, and the loss of innocence. </p>
