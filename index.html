      <h6>Cricket</h6>
      <p>My favourite game is cricket. <b>It is a popularly played sport throughout the world!</b> The best teams from every country make it to the world cup, and people across the globe watch it with interest.
      I love cricket because <b> there is a sense of freedom in playing the game.</b></p>
